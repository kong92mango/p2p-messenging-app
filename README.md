# To run the deliverables:
1. Follow instructions from backend/node-js/README.md first
2. Follow instructions from frontend/react-js/README.md next

# Design & Implementation Challenge
In this challenge, you will be building an instant messaging app that lets multiple users to communicate with one another by sending text messages back and foreth. We have created starter projects for you in a variety of flavors. To complete this challenge, you only need to complete one frontend and one backend implementation. The starter projects provided for you include:
* Frontend (React Native or Flutter preferred)
    * React Native (Typescript)
    * React Native (Javascript)
    * Flutter
    * React Web (Typescript)
    * React Web (Javascript)
* Backend
    * Node (Typescript)
    * Node (Javascript)

Please use this coding challenge as an opportunity to create an app following modern development best practices. Feel free to use your own app architecture preferences (coding standards, code organization, third-party libraries, etc).

## Task
* Develop both the frontend and the backend of a chatroom app that allows multiple people to join and talk to each other in real-time
* User should be allowed to pick a display name (like twitter handle) that does not conflict with anyone else in the chatroom
* When a message is sent, it should be received in real-time by all other users in the chatroom
* The data should persist to a centralized database
* When opening the app, previous messages should be loaded
* You can make use of any framework or technologies at your disposal
* It doesn't need to look pretty, the data structure and your programming style will carry more weight
* You have 48 hours to finish this challenge

## Deliverables
* Create a "dev" branch and commit the code to it. Do not push the code to the master branch.
* Create a pull request with your changes for both the frontend and the backend
* Written instructions to build and run your application
* Once the work is complete, create a pull request from "development" into "master" and send us the link.

## Evaluation Criteria
* Your code should compile and run without errors
* Understanding of design patterns
* The tools of choice to solve the problem
* Code and component reuse/extensibility
* Code design
* Ability to write clear documentation.
* Maintainability of the codebase

# Bonuses
* Use functional programming paradigm
* Use test driven development
* Use strongly typed language (Typescript or Dart)
* Use GraphQL or gRPC instead of REST for backend access

## Have Fun!
This challenge description is intentionally vague in some aspects, but if you need assistance feel free to ask for help.
